# 🚗 CO₂ Emission Prediction Using Machine Learning

### 📌 Overview

This project predicts the CO₂ emissions (g/km) of vehicles using machine learning based on engine specifications and fuel consumption data. It helps environmental teams, automobile manufacturers, and researchers estimate emission levels and support sustainability-focused decisions.

---

## 🧠 Problem Statement

With rising climate concerns and government regulations, predicting vehicle CO₂ emissions accurately is essential.  
This project builds an ML model capable of forecasting emission output based on vehicle specifications.
